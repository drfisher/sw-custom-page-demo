			<h1>Homer Simpson</h1>

			<p>
				Homer Jay Simpson is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons as the patriarch of the eponymous family. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson family got their own series on Fox that debuted December 17, 1989.

				Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies many American working class stereotypes: he is crude, bald, hot-tempered, obese, rule-neglecting, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic; however, he is essentially a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, falling down a cliff while reconciling with his son Bart, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork-chop night in order to take his family out on the town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.
